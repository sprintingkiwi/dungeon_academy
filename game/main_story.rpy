    Each one of you did choose a class this morning. Someone with a reference, someone else as a result of a hard
    work or good luck.
    To all of you I'm here to explain how it will work for the months and years to come.
    As many probably know, every year here at the Academy is divided in two terms, each of them lasting four months.
    The first four months are considered a kind of trial period, in which you will experiment what it means to
    study in a certain class.
    During this first term, you will still be able to apply for a class change.
    Notice that a 'class change request' needs the approval of both the class-masters of the class you are leaving
    and the one you want to enter.
    The class-masters are the main teachers, one for each class. Their judgment is absolute.
    The lessons will be divided in class lessons and optional lessons.
    Every student will need to follow thier class-specific lesson, which will help you consolidate the basics that
    define your class, as well as to internalize the role that each class plays within a party.
    On the other hand, optional lessons are no less important.
    You will need to follow the optional lessons to gain enough credits to be promoted to the next year.
    Thier 'optional' nature will let you choose, at the beginning of every week, the course that will be added to
    your study plan.
    Each course will focus on developing certain skills and abilities. You are free to stick to those most closely
    related to you class, or to acquire a more hybrid mix of competences
    You are here to 'build' yourselves into great adventurers. So make the most of this opportunity.
    With this I say goodbye and good luck to all of you. May the power of the gods be upon you in the time to come.

    That's exactly the point. Rogues started to fit in famous parties of adventurers for their stealth and trickery
    skills, very valuable in dungeons, especially to disarm traps, steal treasures from monsters without fighting,
    or to get informations about enemies.
    But those Rogues usually learnt their skills growing up in the slums as criminals.
    I don't wanna say that they were all bad. Many were just abandoned children with no home and no food...
    Well, anyway, time passed and the Rogue skills became sought after in all parties.
    Many rangers, bards, or even other classes started to train in how to slink, or how to pick a lock, just to
    have more chances of entering strong parties and become rich, famous adventurers.
    But to be called 'Rogue'? Nah! No one wanted it...
    and most adventurers still don't want it now, even if the Rogue has officially been recognized as an Adventurer
    Class by the Council, with a real license and everything else.
    You can now graduate as a Rogue adventurer. Still, in the last years I only had very few students.
    And some years I even had no students. Like THIS year, if it wasn't for you! Hahaha
    People, villagers, kings, everyone still tend to think of rogues as criminals...
    There's no glory in fulfilling a mission if you are a Rogue. No one will acclaim you.
    Or at least not as much as being a proud Paladin, a fierce Fighter, a talented Wizard, or else.

                "Her form begins to change subtly. Her eyes burn brighter, small horns appear on her head, and a tail flicks into view behind her."
                When Gwen reveals her true succubus form, the transformation is as breathtaking as it is unsettling.
                The youthful charm of her academy disguiseâ€”a petite teenage girl with bright, mischievous eyes and a playful smileâ€”is completely shed.
                In its place stands a vision of mature, otherworldly beauty that exudes power and centuries of practiced seduction.
                Gwen's stature shifts dramatically. She now stands taller, her posture commanding and poised, with a natural grace that makes every movement seem deliberate and alluring.
                Her body is no longer girlish but fully matured, with a perfect balance of athleticism and voluptuousness. Her curves are emphasized in a way that feels almost supernaturalâ€”designed to draw the eye and capture attention.
                Her previously soft, pale skin takes on a slight iridescent glow, like moonlight shimmering on a darkened sea. There's a faint hint of crimson along her shoulders and arms, a subtle reminder of her infernal nature.
                Small runic patterns etched in faint gold appear across her skin, pulsating faintly as if alive with magic.
                Gwen's eyes, once bright and playful, now blaze with an intense, glowing crimson hue, framed by thick, dark lashes.
                They seem to pierce directly into the soul, conveying a depth of knowledge and an unspoken promise of ecstasyâ€”and danger.
                Her short, playful haircut elongates into flowing locks of deep, jet-black hair streaked with hints of crimson. Her hair seems almost alive, swaying gently as if caught in an unseen breeze, adding to her otherworldly allure.
                Two sleek, curved horns spiral elegantly from her temples, glossy black with subtle red veins that pulse with heat. They give her an air of regal dominance, as if she's a queen of her infernal realm.
                From her back sprout enormous bat-like wings, their leathery surface marked with faint, glowing runes similar to those on her skin. The wings fold and unfurl gracefully, their movements hypnotic and predatory.
                Her tail, long and sinuous, moves with a mind of its own. It is tipped with a spade-like shape that glimmers faintly, catching the light in a way that seems both playful and threatening.
                Her academy uniform dissolves into a flowing, form-fitting gown of deep black and crimson. The fabric shimmers like liquid obsidian, clinging to her curves while leaving parts of her shoulders, back, and legs daringly exposed.
                The edges of the gown are embroidered with intricate golden patterns resembling infernal script.
                A choker of dark metal adorned with a single ruby rests around her neck, glowing faintly like a heartbeat. Her fingers are adorned with ornate rings, their gemstones pulsating with a faint inner light.
                Gwen's voice, once playful and teasing, becomes richer and more resonant, dripping with confidence and seduction. It's the kind of voice that wraps around you, drawing you closer even when every instinct tells you to run.
                The air around her seems to ripple with heat, not uncomfortable but disorienting, like standing too close to a fire. Her presence is almost magnetic, impossible to ignore, as if every movement and gesture is calculated to ensnare attention.
                A faint, intoxicating aroma follows her, a mix of jasmine, dark spices, and something ineffable that stirs primal instincts.

        You've done your best to put the encounter behind you, burying the memory of Gwen's true form under the routine of academy life. But no matter how hard you try, it lingersâ€”her glowing crimson eyes, the brush of her claws, the unsettling mix of fear and fascination.

        Then one day, she returns.

        You're sitting in the academy courtyard, trying to focus on a particularly dense passage in one of your magical theory books. The chatter of students fills the air, a comforting background noiseâ€”until you hear a familiar voice behind you.

        "Miss me?"

        Your heart stops. You turn, and there she isâ€”Gwen, back in her playful, mischievous academy disguise. She's dressed in the same student uniform, her hair cropped short again, her bright eyes gleaming with amusement. She looks harmless, normal even, but you know better now.

        "You're still alive. I have to admit, I'm impressed," she says, sliding onto the bench beside you as if nothing has changed. "I thought you might've run off to some temple by now, begging a cleric to ward me away."

        You shift uncomfortably, the memory of her true form flashing in your mind. "What are you doing here, Gwen?"

        She leans in closer, her voice dropping to a conspiratorial whisper. "You, of course. I told you, didn't I? There's something about you, something... deliciously unique."

        Her words send a shiver down your spine. "I thought you already got what you wanted," you say, trying to keep your voice steady.

        She laughs softly, the sound both charming and unnerving. "Oh, I tried. Believe me, I tried. But whatever is anchoring your soul to your body? It's powerful. Too powerful for even me to break through. I need to figure out what it is."

        You swallow hard, unsure whether to feel relieved or terrified. "And why does that matter to you?"

        Gwen's playful smirk fades, replaced by something more serious. "Because your soul, my dear, was the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. Centuries of seduction, centuries of taking what I want, and nothing has ever come close to the sweetness of you. And I couldn't even finish the meal."

        Her words hang in the air, and you feel a cold sweat forming on your brow.

        "But don't worry," she adds, her smirk returning as she rests her chin in her hand. "I'm not here to hurt you. Yet. I just... need to figure you out. For now, you're safe. Think of me as... a friend."

        "A friend," you repeat, incredulous.

        She grins. "Why not? Who else knows your secret? Who else can help you understand what's going on with that soul of yours?"

        Her words have a strange logic to them, even if every instinct tells you to stay as far away from her as possible.

        "So, what do you say?" Gwen asks, her voice dropping to a low, honeyed tone. "Want to figure this out together?"

        You hesitate. The memory of her glowing eyes and infernal wings looms large, but there's something else tooâ€”a curiosity, a faint pull that you can't entirely resist.

        "I don't trust you, Gwen. Stay away from me."
