On a failed save, it takes 14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage can't reduce the target's hit points below 1. If the target fails the saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature's hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."], "range": "60 feet", "components": ["V", "S"], "ritual": false, "duration": "Instantaneous", "concentration": false, "casting_time": "1 action", "level": 6, "damage": {"damage_type": {"index": "necrotic", "name": "Necrotic", "url": "/api/damage-types/necrotic"}, "damage_at_slot_level": {"6": "14d6"}}, "dc": {"dc_type": {"index": "con", "name": "CON", "url": "/api/ability-scores/con"}, "dc_success": "half"}, "school": {"index": "necromancy", "name": "Necromancy", "url": "/api/magic-schools/necromancy"}, "classes": [{"index": "cleric", "name": "Cleric", "url": "/api/classes/cleric"}], "subclasses": [], "url": "/api/spells/harm"}
