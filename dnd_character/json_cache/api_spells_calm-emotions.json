{"index": "calm-emotions", "name": "Calm Emotions", "desc": ["You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make a charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two effects. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened. When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration has not expired in the meantime.", "Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again, unless the DM rules otherwise."], "range": "60 feet", "components": ["V", "S"], "ritual": false, "duration": "Up to 1 minute", "concentration": true, "casting_time": "1 action", "level": 2, "dc": {"dc_type": {"index": "cha", "name": "CHA", "url": "/api/ability-scores/cha"}, "dc_success": "none"}, "area_of_effect": {"type": "sphere", "size": 20}, "school": {"index": "enchantment", "name": "Enchantment", "url": "/api/magic-schools/enchantment"}, "classes": [{"index": "bard", "name": "Bard", "url": "/api/classes/bard"}, {"index": "cleric", "name": "Cleric", "url": "/api/classes/cleric"}], "subclasses": [{"index": "lore", "name": "Lore", "url": "/api/subclasses/lore"}], "url": "/api/spells/calm-emotions"}
