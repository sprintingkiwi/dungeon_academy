{"name": "Using Ability Scores", "index": "using-ability-scores", "desc": "# Using Ability Scores\n\nSix abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:\n- **Strength**, measuring physical power\n- **Dexterity**, measuring agility\n- **Constitution**, measuring endurance\n- **Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory\n- **Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight\n- **Charisma**, measuring force of personality\n\nIs a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses.\n\nThe three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.\n\n**Ability Scores and Modifiers** Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability.\n\nA score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.\n\nEach ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30.\n", "subsections": [{"name": "Ability Scores and Modifiers", "index": "ability-scores-and-modifiers", "url": "/api/rule-sections/ability-scores-and-modifiers"}, {"name": "Advantage and Disadvantage", "index": "advantage-and-disadvantage", "url": "/api/rule-sections/advantage-and-disadvantage"}, {"name": "Proficiency Bonus", "index": "proficiency-bonus", "url": "/api/rule-sections/proficiency-bonus"}, {"name": "Ability Checks", "index": "ability-checks", "url": "/api/rule-sections/ability-checks"}, {"name": "Using Each Ability", "index": "using-each-ability", "url": "/api/rule-sections/using-each-ability"}, {"name": "Saving Throws", "index": "saving-throws", "url": "/api/rule-sections/saving-throws"}], "url": "/api/rules/using-ability-scores"}
